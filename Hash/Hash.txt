# What is a Hash Function? Source(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
	A hash function is any function that maps data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size.
	The values returned by hash functions are called hash values, hash codes, disgests, or hashes.
	(Sorry for copy/paste, this is a solid explanation.)

# What is a Hash Map or Hash Table?
	Both are data structures that maps keys to values. It essentially computes a hash function to index into an array of buckets
	or slots. Each index contains a linked-list so that whenever collisions occur, the new element will be inserted into that list. 

# What is the difference between a Hash Map and Hash Table?
	HashTables are synchronized and HashMaps are unsynchronized. This means that manipulating HashMaps are faster because
	there is no synchronization overhead. Synchronization is generally when there is a lock for adding/removing/reading/writing
	to a certain thing, and in this case, it is the HashTable. Synchronization is great for reliability and robustness.

# What is a HashSet?
	A HashSet is a data structure where the list of values that are unique. Other interesting things:
	1. In random order
	2. If inserted with a duplicate element, new element will override old element
	3. Non-synchronized

# Complexity of HashMaps/HashTables
	Insertion/Deletion/Search: O(1)
	Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the elements inside the data structure	

# Hash Function in Java (Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9364134/what-hashing-function-does-java-use-to-implement-hashtable-class)
	It seems that Java has it's own HashFunction that is built in. You can also first pass in your own hash function, which will be used 
	on top of the hash function in java. If there is a lot of collision, where a bunch of elements are put into one bucket in the 
	hash map, the search complexity will go up to O(n). To prevent attackers from exploiting this, there is another random element used 
	when hashing in a hash map.

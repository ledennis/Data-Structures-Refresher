# Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
	1. The big key difference from what I can tell is that Classes can only extend one Abstract Class while they can implement multiple interfaces
	2. Subclasses of abstract classes DO NOT need to implement all functions of abstract class BUT they then must become abstract themselves.
	3. Classes that implements interfaces MUST implement every function.
	4. In interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final and any methods are public. Where in abstract classes, fields can be not static and final, and methods can be public/protected/private.

# Methods in Java
	1. public -
	2. protected - 
	3. private -
	4. abstract -

# Classes in Java
	1. public
	2. abstract
